Brief description

The library libOAF/Qt ((O)bject (A)ctivation (F)ramework) was created
for C++/Qt developers. It allows to use very flexible component-based
architecture in the program, where components are linked with each other
using a few number of programming interfaces.

The term "component" should be understood as "shared library with special code",
and the specific description (what interfaces are exported, what are required
for this component, and so on).

This library was actively used in development of requirements 
management system called "Picket" (rus. "Пикет", http://piket.org.ru).

===============================================================================
System requirements

This Library can be build in any operating system where are available:
- C++03 and higher compiler
- Qt framework version 4 or higher

The library was compiled and heavily tested under such platforms:
- Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2010/ Qt 4.8
- (K)Ubuntu Linux / gcc 4.8 / Qt 4.8

The others are waiting for beta-testers, so you are always welcome :)

Brief history

The Library was based on GNOME OAF/Bonobo ideas. But it was designed
for concrete challanges, and not pretend to be absolutely unversal tool.

It helped us to:
* separate coding and program architecture design: the last one
  can be described in programming interfaces terms
* split program to the several components, where each of the components
  is so independent from others as it can be
* make the program extensible in the runtime using additional components

So it:
* Simplify the Team Leader work with program design
* Simplify programmers collaboration:
  each of them just coding in his own sandbox (component)
* Allows to create plugin-based applications, which can be
  easily extended in runtime without any recompile/patching;
  just add new component even after program installation
